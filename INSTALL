# Installation Instructions for DFA (Degap Fasta Alignment)

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and install this project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- `autoconf`
- `automake`
- `gcc` (or another C compiler)
- `make`
- `zlib` development libraries

On a Debian-based system, you can install these prerequisites using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gcc make zlib1g-dev
```

## Building from Source

Follow these steps to build the project from source:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nylander/degap_fasta_alignment.git
   cd degap_fasta_alignment
   ```

2. **Generate the Configuration Script:**

   ```sh
   aclocal
   autoconf
   automake --add-missing
   ```

3. **Configure the Build:**

   ```sh
   ./configure
   ```

4. **Compile the Project:**

   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Installing the Program

To install the program, run the following command with superuser privileges:

```sh
sudo make install
```

This will install the `dfa` executable to `/usr/local/bin` by default. You can
specify a different installation prefix by passing the `--prefix` option to the
`./configure` script. For example, if you have a `$HOME/bin` folder:

```sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the `dfa` program from the command line. For usage information, you can run:

```sh
dfa -h
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the program, run the following command with superuser privileges:

```sh
sudo make uninstall
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove the generated files from the build process, run:

```sh
make clean
```

To remove all files generated by the `configure` script, run:

```sh
make distclean
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please check the following:

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
- Verify that you have the necessary permissions to run the installation commands.
- Review the output of the `configure` and `make` commands for any error messages.

If you still have problems, feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub page.
